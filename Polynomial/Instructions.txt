run program with arguments:

./Polynomial.exe 0 "function in quotes or speech marks" start_num end_num out_filename
./Polynomial.exe 1 in_filename
./Polynomial.exe 2 in_filename out_filename

option 0 generates a sequence from an input function, displays to user then writes to file
option 1 reads in a sequence and derives an equation
option 2 reads in several sequences, derives their equations and writes them to an output file
